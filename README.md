# Time Series Forecasting of Energy Consumption Using XGBoost: A Comprehensive Methodology  

This notebook presents an end-to-end workflow for applying gradient-boosted decision trees to predict hourly energy consumption patterns. By combining temporal feature engineering with XGBoost's advanced regression capabilities, we demonstrate a robust approach to time series forecasting that accounts for seasonal patterns, autoregressive dependencies, and calendar effects. Our analysis of PJM Interconnection's historical load data (2002-2018) reveals XGBoost's effectiveness in handling complex energy forecasting challenges while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Foundational Concepts in Modern Time Series Forecasting  

### The Evolution of Energy Demand Prediction  
Time series forecasting has become indispensable in energy grid management, where accurate predictions directly impact operational efficiency and infrastructure planning. Traditional statistical methods like ARIMA dominated early forecasting efforts through their explicit modeling of autocorrelation and differencing components. However, the machine learning revolution introduced new paradigms for handling:  

1. **High-dimensional feature spaces** through automatic relevance detection  
2. **Non-linear relationships** via hierarchical decision trees  
3. **Missing data robustness** using built-in imputation strategies  

XGBoost emerged as particularly effective for energy forecasting due to its native support for:  
- Custom objective functions for asymmetric loss scenarios  
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting on large temporal datasets  
- Built-in feature importance calculations for operational insights
